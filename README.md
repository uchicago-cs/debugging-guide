# The Debugging Guide

This repository contains a debugging guide used at the University of Chicago. 
Please visit http://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide to read the guide. The examples
mentioned in the guide can be found in the `examples/` directory of this repository.

This guide is currently in a very preliminary stage, and only covers C. In the future, 
it will also cover Python and will also include content on how to use a number of debugging tools beyond GDB.
